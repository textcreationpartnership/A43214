         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I ſay, when I put theſe particulars to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with the invidious Aſpect caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this growing Province by the reſt of its Neighbours, I expect not it ſhould be able to perform now, what it did under a happier Government in a more uſeful League and Conſederacy in <hi>Guicciardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>'s time.</p>
                  <p>2. Firſt ſo much given to Tumults are the fierce and rough, Inhabtants of <hi>Zealand.</hi> 12. So full of awls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are their <hi>Hooſden,</hi> or the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:32038:97"/> merry monthly meetings deſigned to promote friendſhip and good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. 3. So Lawleſs and Pyrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally given are their Seamen and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. 4. So deceitful, and apt to betray their confederates for an Intereſt. 5. So ſottiſh, whoriſh, and licentious. 6. So Impatient of Order, I awes, Rules, or Government. 7. Such the claſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Admiral, and the Admiral of the States-General. 8. So little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can their Treaſurers at <hi>Middleburgh</hi> give, of their antient Revenue by French Wines, Salt, Oyles, or Eaſtern Trades. 9. So weak are their Banks and Rampires, though painfully made, and chargably maintained, being at beſt but 7. Ells in heighth, and 17. in breadth at bottom made of the hardeſt Clay that can be gotten, in the inſide ſtuffed with Wood and Stone, on the outſide covered with Matts; a weak defence God knoweth, againſt a ſtroug Enemy, and a ſtronger Stream. 10.

                  <p>3. Conſidering 1. That but half <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland</hi> is under the States-General, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open in the other half to none of their beſt friends. 2. That their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Chancellour are of late ſo much diſobliged. 3. That the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Province, are ſo dilatory, as depending ſo much on its particular Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as <hi>Zuphten, &amp;c.</hi> which could never ſince the Revolt grow towards a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo many irregular hands &amp; heads being concerned in each Vote. 4. That it hath ſo ill a Neighbour as <hi>Brabant, Cleveland,</hi> and <hi>Bradenburgh;</hi> that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince at this juncture in my Opinion, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes up a number: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was once ſo fruitful, that a <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland</hi> Bull was ſold at <hi>Antwerp</hi> 1570, that weighed 3000 pound weight; and pretendedly ſo ſtrong, that it boaſts of 16 walled Towns; though thoſe upon the <hi>Eure</hi> and <hi>Maſe</hi> lie very open to the Lord of the Sea.</p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:32038:98"/>
                  <p>4. <hi>Zuphten</hi> is ſo ill befriended by <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of it, and by <hi>Cleveland</hi> on the <hi>South;</hi> ſo ſuſpicious is the preſent Governour of <hi>Zuphten,</hi> ſo hardly came the Vote for Subſities out of their 12 Senators, that I may neglect it as much, as Duke <hi>Alva</hi> did 1573.</p>
                  <p>5. The maritine <hi>Friezlanders</hi> have 1. ſo little uſe of their Nets; The Inland Countreymen or Husbandmen judge themſelves 2. So little concern'd in the Quarrel. 3. So intent they are upon the peaceful arts of Paſturage, and Tillage. 4. So much do they pleaſe themſelves with their very fancy of Liberty and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. 5. So hardly will they part with their Money. 6. So Modeſt, Meek, and Quiet they are, and given to hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hawking. 7. So jealous are the Proteſtants of <hi>Weſt-Friezland,</hi> who are under the States of the Catholicks of <hi>Weſt-Friezland,</hi> who are under an Earl of their own, that the <hi>Frizons</hi> are neither very able, nor willing to dance after the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Companies Pipes in <hi>Holland;</hi> and the rather, becauſe though ſurrounded with water, yet not ſo liable

                  <p>6.

                  <p>7.

Their Diet was courſe, and of every mans own providing. 12. They ſpent money for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but now their time in drinking. 13. They Trafficked for others ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, but not their own. 14. Their
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:32038:102"/> Apparel was plain, and their Ambition onely upon Realities and Solidities. 14. Their Lawes were ſtrictly executed, and no forfeitures left to the corrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of an Officer, but all beſtowed upon the Publick. 15. Uſury was a ſtranger to them, every man laying out his Eſtate upon the Publick-traffick. 16. No idleneſs there, and therefore no thievery; a fault more effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained there by Whipping, than here by Hanging. 17. If any man gained there extraordinarily by money, the tenth of his gain was the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths; Uſurers eſcaping not there as here. 18. One undone by caſuality, they ſet up; one caſt to Priſon, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor maintains; one troubled with a ſhifting Adverſary, a quick tryal relieves. 19. All men debated, and all contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Publick affairs, as concerned both by advice and purſe. 20. Their Reſolutions were ſecret and ſudden. 21.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:32038:103"/> have been to be ſouldiers before they were <hi>men.</hi> 23. They have been a hardy and a head-ſtrong people, and you might ſooner convert a Jew to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, turn an old Puritane, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a Dutchman of Reaſon. 24. Not a man of them but might have been a Stateſman, for they have all this gift, not to be too nice-conſcienced. 25. They were ſeldom deceived, for they truſted no body, though every body muſt truſt them. 26. They love none but thoſe they profit by. 27. Complement is an idleneſs thoſe brutiſh people were never skilled in; they are half marred being Saylors, and being Souldiers they are quite ſpoiled; for there (ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour) they would let a Jew build a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where <hi>Harlem-Mear</hi> is, and after that couzen them of it. 28. They have had a Religion, and a Liberty, of both which they were very zealous formerly, and are as careleſs now. 29. They have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Eaſterlings</hi> trade in the North, and ours in the Eaſt. 30. Their watches were ſeldom of a Nation, ſo that they could ſeldom concur to deliver up one Town. 31. They were very ſtrict upon

Their ſouldiers are well Cloathed, Armed, Diſciplined, and paid; the ſouldiers ſeldom any where commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fewer inſolencies upon the people, or the Officers fewer deceits upon the ſouldiers. 33. Their General could not betray them, his Army being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of many ſeveral Nations; his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers not at his own, but at the States diſpoſal; and his Commiſſion never Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly left to his diſcretion, but by reaſon their Countrey hath no great bounds, he receives daily commands what to do. 34.
